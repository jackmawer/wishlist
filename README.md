## Wishlist ##
**Wishlist** is a free web app that allows any user to quickly create and share wishlists, with drag-and-drop functionality.
###View###
Wishlist is currently in development and unavailable to test.
### Free vs Pro ###
We intend that all features currently available remain free for as long as it is possible to support the product as so. In order to carry this out, we plan to release a pro version in future with extra features paid for by monthly subscription to support future development of the product.
###License###
This web application has some code sourced from the [Wekan project on Github](//github.com/wekan/wekan) and is therefore subject to the very permissive MIT License which can be viewed [here](LICENSE).
